- Character count with validation
- Timer countdown for post expiration
- Anonymous posting (no authentication required)

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime subscriptions
- **Hosting**: Replit
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with cyberpunk theme

## Quick Deploy on Replit

### Prerequisites
- Replit account
- Supabase account and project

### Deployment Steps

1. **Fork or Create New Repl**
   - Go to replit.com
   - Create a new Node.js Repl
   - Name it "VoidStream"

2. **Upload Project Files**
   - Copy all files from this repository
   - Ensure all files are in the root directory

3. **Configure Database**
   - Set up Supabase project
   - Run the SQL setup script (see Database Setup section)

4. **Set Environment Variables** (Recommended)
   - Go to Replit Secrets tab
   - Add `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

5. **Deploy**
   - Click the "Run" button in Replit
   - Your app will be live instantly

## Database Setup

### Supabase Configuration

1. Create a new Supabase project
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Run this SQL script:

```sql
-- Create the posts table
create table if not exists posts (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  content text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
);

-- Enable Row Level Security
alter table posts enable row level security;

-- Allow everyone to read posts
create policy "Anyone can read posts" 
  on posts for select 
  using (true);

-- Allow everyone to create posts  
create policy "Anyone can insert posts" 
  on posts for insert 
  with check (true);

-- Enable real-time subscriptions
alter publication supabase_realtime add table posts;
```

### Environment Variables

For security, set these in Replit Secrets:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
